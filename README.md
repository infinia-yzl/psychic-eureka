# üå† StarRailInfinity üå†

Welcome to **StarRailInfinity** - a simple proxy designed to fetch publicly available data from the official game's API of [Honkai: Star Rail](https://hsr.hoyoverse.com/). 

Built with a vision to improve and simplify data access, this project reflects my passion for the game and the broader community.

## Features:

### Current:
- **Proxy Access**: Directly fetch game data. A straightforward gateway to the game's publicly available details.
- **Basic Caching**: Minimize redundant API calls.
- **Fully Typed**: Built with TypeScript, ensure type-safe interactions and predictable responses.
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Utilises Bun's built-in testing functionality to ensure reliability.

### Upcoming:
1. **Indexing**: The plan isn't just to fetch, but to remember. I'm aiming to store player data for even swifter retrievals down the line.
2. **Insights**: I'm excited about the potential to delve into the nuances of player data. Imagine drawing meaningful patterns, understanding trends, and even perhaps making game strategy suggestions. The data holds stories, and I intend to narrate them.

## üíª Getting Started:

This project is built with: 
- [Bun](https://bun.sh/) - Bun is a fast Javascript all-in-one toolkit. *It's similar to node.*
- [Elysia](https://elysiajs.com/) - ElysiaJS is a fast, and friendly Bun web framework.

1. **Install Dependencies**:

    ```bash
    bun install
    ```

2. **Test**:

   ```bash
    bun test
    ```

3. **Run the Server**:

    ```bash
    bun start
    ```
   
    or in `dev` mode
    
    ```bash
    bun dev
    ```

4. **Documentation and Testing**:

    - **Swagger OpenAPI Docs**: [http://localhost:3001/swagger](http://localhost:3001/swagger)
    - **Fetch a User**: [http://localhost:3001/user/{uuid}](http://localhost:3001/user/{uuid}) (Replace `{uuid}` with the specific user's UUID)
